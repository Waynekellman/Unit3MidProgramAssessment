Unit 3 Mid-Program Assessment

I finished everything in the assessment.
I think I did the AsyncTask pretty well.
I felt pretty confident in everything but getting the fragment manager for the final fragment transaction. I did it but I found it the most difficult because I wasn't particulaly familar with the process.
